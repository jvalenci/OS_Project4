To run our program its quite simple.

1. Run the make command in the same directory as the program files.
2. Run the ./unix_metrics program with no command line arguments.
3. The first thing the program will do is create a test file of 3G in the /tmp directory
   if you do not have one already.
4. Then, a prompt will appear which will ask the user what test they want to run. The user has to pick 
   an integer 1-5 inclusive or 0 to exit.
